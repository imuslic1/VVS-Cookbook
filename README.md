# VVS Cookbook

## Overview

This repository was created as part of a project on the "Software Verification and Validation" course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo. 
The aim of the project is to study various verification and validation methods and practice on a console app. 

## The application

The console app is a cookbook that allows for adding, reading and rating recipes, adding and reading ingredients in those recipes, 
generating shopping lists based on the given prices per unit of measurement for each ingredient, as well as calculating energetic values for the recipes in 
calories. The goal is to have a functional app that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed using various agile software development methods.
